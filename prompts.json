    "title": "Collapsing Ringworld Library",
    "narrative_role": "opening",
    "prompt_text": "Wide establishing shot of a crystalline library on a collapsing ringworld. A courier android stands at the edge of a glass‑ribbed walkway, towering shelves of crystalline archives shimmer around them as pieces of the ring arc peel away into space. Shot type: ultra‑wide 24 mm, high perspective showing scale. Composition: sweeping arcs, strong vanishing point. Include floating debris and holographic glyphs swirling in the air. Art style: iridescent bio‑tech realism with cathedral‑scale hard‑sci‑fi forms; subtle neon‑noir mood; consistent palette of teal/indigo with copper accents. Lighting/composition: volumetric rim light and soft god rays shining through fractal glass. Rendering intent: high detail, clean edges. Avoid: text, watermarks, artifacts."

    "prompt_text": "Mid shot of the courier android reaching into a crystalline vault to seize a glowing living star‑seed, veins of light coursing through its transparent hands. Background shows fractal circuitry and luminous data streams. Shot type: 50 mm, medium close‑up capturing hands and star‑seed. Composition: centered focus with subtle diagonal lines. Art style: iridescent bio‑tech realism with cathedral‑scale hard‑sci‑fi forms; subtle neon‑noir mood; consistent palette of teal/indigo with copper accents.
